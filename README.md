# chemical-formolar-node
This is a project that have always been on the back of my mind when I think about working on a interface application. An intuitive calculator the help you solve and understand the relationships between units in chemistry. The idea is simple, each equation is represented by a node, the edges of a node is the variable used in the equation.
Right now, this project is pushing the limit of my knowledge gap.  I feel like need to invest more time in learning languages. Instead, another version of this app should be on Kaitoon bot, which does similiar thing minus the interface and calculation parts.
